This should mirror the section in your README, or the README should point them here.\n\nPrerequisites\nDefine the software and hardware requirements needed to run the workflow.\nThe workflow requires the following software:\n\nPixi: Creates the environment for running the workflow.\nGit: Version control\nA container runtime: Docker (for local testing) or Singularity/Apptainer (recommended for HPC).\n\nInclude expected resource usage on a typical dataset if possible, such as memory, CPU, runtime, and disk usage.\nThis workflow can run on standard HPC nodes with at least 16 GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores. Typical runtime for a whole-exome sequencing sample pair is approximately 6-8 hours, depending on the dataset size and computational resources allocated.\n\n\nHow to run/install\nSupply a tiny dataset for testing purposes, along with example commands to run the workflow.\nNextflow Example:\n# Open a Pixi shell to create an environment for running the workflow.\npixi shell\n# Runs a small, defined test case using pre-configured containers.\nnextflow run main.nf -profile test,docker\nSnakemake Example:\n# Runs with a minimal config file, leveraging Conda environments.\nsnakemake --use-conda -j 4 --configfile config/test_config.yaml"
